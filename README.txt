To run the app for the fist time:
1) Deploy BacPac:  Database->Training->training.bacpac
2) Build "Training" database proyect and publish to the same database you deployed in the first step 
   This will create and populate the "big" tables 
3) Ensure you update the connection string from the App.config in StockAdmin solution
